What has inside?

The solution of Stochastic Inverse Problems (SIPs) concerned with statistical and engineering inference for physical parameters in complex systems implies the impact of support of physical parameters on loss of information and bias, and the assumptions on which it is based in previous work may not be satisfied in many applications, such as systems measured at a large collection of times. We consider the solution of the SIP using all the information in multiple collections of observations of system behavior, which provides a way to analyze physical systems where the observed quantities are physically close and are nearly indiscernible and a method for constructing a relatively small region of support for the solution. In addition, we propose a solution for the SIP that is obtained by computing the integral of solutions computed from multiple collections of observations, which reduces the bias in some sense. Some information-theoretic results are also illustrated to quantify solutions of the SIP. [Demo](assets/files/Prelim_Slides (1).pdf). This is a simple and minimalist template for Jekyll for those who likes to eat noodles.
