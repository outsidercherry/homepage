<p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Colorado State University. Before coming to CSU, I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China.</p>

<p>My doctoral research focuses on 1) developing methodologies of some interesting topics, such as domain recovery and marginal compute, in Stochastic Inverse Problems. 2) investigating useful and fast algorithms for Stochastic Inverse Problems; 3) developing statistical and mathematical methodologies and theory for engineering and statistical problems, such as Spatio-tempro processes;</p>
